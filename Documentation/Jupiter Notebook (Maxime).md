A Jupyter Notebook allows us to run Python code while writing some text to add documentation.

You can run Python code step by step following the documentation between each part of code.

## Our utilisation of Jupyter Notebook in Gaia Application

By adding some text between lines of code, the understanding of code is improved and more readable.

* You can find our Jupyter Notebook in :
