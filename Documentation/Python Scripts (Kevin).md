In Gaia Sky we can use Python to move through space, and coordinate ourselves. This is done using Jython.

## Jython

Jython is an implementation of Python that is able to be executed in the Java Runtime Enviremont. There are some main differences between Python and Jython. Supposenly Jython has more pro's and no cons we encountered. 

Jython makes use of Java classes instead of Python modules (this is a pro because we don't have to worry about multi-inheritance maintenance problems). But in does inlcude almost all Python binary C modules. So in the case of GUI's this fact makes it possible to write a Jython user interface in Swing, AWT or SWT (in Python based code ;) ). One of Jython's most interesting features is that it compiles to Java Bytecode on demand or statically. 


Jython is maintained by the Python software foundation and is one of the referenced JVM scripting languages.
