# Isosurfaces

Isosurfaces are three dimensional computer animations used to visualise (mostly) fluids and gasses. 

In the case of Gaia Sky these are ionizing meshes, which contain mostly hydrogen. 

The isosurface indicates the overdensity of stars.
Where there are alot of 'hot and/or massive stars of spectral type O and/or B', a isosurface will apear. The higher the density, the more red the area will become, the lower the density, the more blue the area will become.
