# Datasets

One of the beautiful things about Gaia Sky is the option to add available datasets. We were very excited about all the possible datsets. 
But we encountered one big problem: "We are not able too add all the datsets we want to add". 

Examples of datasets we to add are:
* APOGEE & AVOGEE-RC
* RAVE
* LAMOST
* GALAH DR1

These datasets can be compared to TGAS, GAIA DR1 and GAIA DR2 as shown here: https://github.com/jobovy/gaia_tools 

Unfortunately we were not able to add these datasets too Gaia Sky because the developers of Gaia Sky reformated the datasets too their needs. 
This is not a huge problem since they've done this for multiple datasets as can be seen here: https://zah.uni-heidelberg.de/institutes/ari/gaia/outreach/gaiasky/downloads/ 

We added all the datasets that are available in this format and did research on ways too use the other datasets. In the Jupyter folder there is a tutorial on how to add these datasets to Gaia Sky.
